## Introduction

### About me

I am a postgraduate student current undertaking a MSc in Urban Spatial Science at UCL (expected graduation = August 2024). \
My background is in geography/geographic information systems/remote sensing. My Bachelor's was a Joint-Degree between the National University of Singapore and University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. \
My other interests include hiking, drone piloting/photogrpahy and board games.

### Day 10: North America

### Day 9: Hexagons

### Day 8: Africa

### Day 7: Navigation

### Day 6: Asia

### Day 5: Analog Map

Drew various maps by hand, based on the Pokemon series.

While I lack the artistic talent, I would recommend looking up King of Maps, a map shop in Cusco, Peru. Their hand-drawn maps are hands down some of the most aesthetically pleasing and detailed maps I seen. I also appreciate how there is greater South American representation in their maps.

### Day 4: A bad map

What makes a bad map? Is it the absence of good analysis and/or good visualisation?. Overall, poor analysis with good visualisation is probably more dangerous.

The map below is a mashup of random datasets I could find. Visually it is repulsive and I do not think much useful insights could be gleam from it.

### Day 3: Polygon

Using data from The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, I extracted the most consumed starch in each country for 2021.

I then plotted two versions: a normal one and one where the polygons are filled with images of starches.

### Day 2: Lines

Extracted a hiking route from AllTrails and convert all the points into a polyline. I then georeference the file in QGIS against a basemap. The line changes colour with elevation which shows how the final push to the submit will be the most intense. I chose Snowdon as it is a hike I hope to conquer in my time here as well.

### Day 1: Points

I accessed and downloaded my Instagram Post data (refer to https://lnkd.in/eabi6Nz8 on how to get your own data & screenshot for how the data looks like. Only posts which were geotagged will have coordinates).

I subsequently extracted out the coordinates of my posts before plotting the points and setting the background to Instagram's colour scheme. From the map, most of the points are concentrated in Singapore (home) and US (where I spent a year abroad).

Given that there is more attention to the replicability of research, I will also be sharing the code I use and most of the datasets (except when it involves data privacy).
